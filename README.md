Social media network analysis helps in understanding the dynamics of social interactions, behaviours, and trends within digital platforms. 

<br>
In this project, we analyse centrality measures on two popular social media user datasets - Amazon and Facebook, using Python programming and the Stanford Network Analysis Platform.

Tasks:
1. Find size of the network and degree of each node.
2. Find paths, components, connectivity and clustering measures in the networks. 
3. Find centrality measures to gauge user importance using - betweenness centrality, closeness centrality and biased PageRank.
